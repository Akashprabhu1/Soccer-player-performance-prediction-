# Soccer-player-performance-prediction-
This project predicts soccer player performance using a Random Forest Regressor. It preprocesses the data by dropping unnecessary columns, filling missing values, and calculating an average performance metric based on goals and assists. The model is trained and tested, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.25.
